===========================================================

Let's say we have twelve numbered balls on the table
o o o o o o o o o o o o
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
Choose one of them and decide if it will weigh heavier or lighter than the rest.
The rest will weight the same. Now my task is to guess which ball you picked and whether it
weighs more or less than the other balls using my handy scale only three times.
